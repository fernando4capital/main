## History

I am a techie with a love for interacting with human beings. This is one of my best features and qualities. 

I have been working in the software development industry since I was 15, when I created my first paid project - a system to assist hundreds of local retailers and banks in managing customer loan risks. This was a precursor to the credit score system. 

Since then, I have been recognized for my computer skills and have worked for companies such as Microsoft, where I have held various positions including programmer, software developer, backend developer, frontend developer, site reliability engineer, and project manager. 

Throughout my career, I have had the opportunity to work on projects for banks, insurance companies, startups, and Fortune 500 corporations using a wide range of technologies and software languages, including C, C++, C#, Go, JavaScript with Typescript, Python, and Rust. 

I have also had the chance to work with various operational systems, such as Linux and Microsoft, and companies like Amazon and Google. 

Currently, I work remotely from anywhere in the world and am constantly improving myself by utilizing various technologies, tools, frameworks, and hardware.

Thank you for finding me. Feel free to send me a message at fernando4capital@gmail.com to chat and see how I can help you. Success!
