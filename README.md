## History

I'm a Techie, and I'm a Financial Geek. I love interactions with human beings. This is one of my best features and quality.

History:
When I was 15, I created my first paid project. A system to assist hundreds of local retailers and Banks in managing customer loan risks, basically a precursor of the Credit Score system.

Soon after, recruiters recognized my computer skills, and I started to work for one of the largest companies of the 1990s - Microsoft.

I was called a Programmer, Software Developer, Backend Developer or Frontend Developer, Full-Stack Developer, Software Engineer, Project Manager, and Software Engineering Manager.

All those position names are just a layer of what I am, and what I performed.

As I told you: Techie, a Financial Geek, and I love interactions with human beings. 

I was able to witness the birth of the Personal Computer software development industry and as a curious researcher does, I learned and experienced a vast amount of software languages and technology.

Now I work remotely from anywhere in the world, constantly improving myself by utilizing various technologies, software languages, tools, frameworks, operational systems, and hardware.

I've worked on projects for the largest banks in Brazil, France, and Germany, as well at insurance companies in France, utilizing a wide range of technologies and software languages, from C to Python and from C++ to Go and Rust, or from C# to JavaScript with Typescript.

Furthermore, I had the opportunity to create software for a wide range of businesses at all levels, from startups to Fortune 500 corporations, using a variety of technologies ranging from Amazon to Google and operational systems ranging from Linux to Microsoft.

Thank you so much for finding me. 

Please, send me a message at fernando4capital@gmail.com 

Let's talk and see how I can help you. Success!
